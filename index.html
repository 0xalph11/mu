			<h1>Î¼</h1>

			<p>We're two partners investing our own money with the goal of replicating Berkshire Hathaway's success, adapted for future trends.</p>

			<p>We invest up to $10M per deal with an infinite time horizon across public equities, private equity, metaverse, real estate, and art.</p>

			<p>We maintain a concentrated barbell portfolio, investing in assets with strong, sustainable feedback loops.</p>

			<p>For growth investments, we look for innovative teams and nations that are building the future of healthcare, transportation, and finance. These convex bets have a higher rate of failure but offer a larger return opportunity.</p>

			<p>For value investments, we look for depressed assets and nations with strong intrinsic values such as cash flow, moat, or productivity. We prefer assets in inefficient markets featuring a margin of safety.</p>

			<p>We also have an emerging investment thesis around culture. We invest in businesses and art that command sustainable mindshare.</p>
